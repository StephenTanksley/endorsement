# 7.9 Circular Array

# Implement a CircularArray class that supports an array-like data 
    # structure which can be efficiently rotated.
# If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a 
    # template) and should support iteration via the standard for
    # (Obj o:  circularArray) notation.

# CircularArray
    # items, head
    # convert (index), rotate (shift_right), get (i), set(i, item)
