# Day of Week That Is k Days Later

# Days of the week are represented as three-letter strings. 
    # "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"
# Write a javaScript function solution that, given a string 
    # S representing the day of the week and an integer K 
    # (between 0 and 500), returns the day of the week that 
    # is K days later. 

# For example, given S = "Wed" and K = 2, the function 
    # should return "Fri".
# Given S = "Sat" and K = 23, the function should return 
    # "Mon".
