# Endorsement Repo

This is mostly my Cracking the Coding Interview challenge answers as well as copies of my notes from my time at Lambda.  

## Learning Resources
I can't recommend [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com) enough as a great base or starter place to go for your knowledge.  There are a TON of different languages, frameworks, and fundamental computer science concepts explained there, including object-oriented design, data science and algorithms, how to use various cloud providers, languages, frameworks, operating systems, and more.  Study and take notes on that, and then any videos you go on to watch or other things you do to learn will be very easy to understand and follow through on.  Also I am a huge fan of [Front End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/).  Lambda students receive a free six-month sub as part of the GitHub Student Pack.

### Note Taking
YMMV, but I highly recommend [Cornell note-taking](http://lawyerist.com/75163/cornell-method-note-taking/?utm_source=lawyerist_sidebar) style for note taking with a weekly review (answering the questions) to stay refreshed on what you learned.
